# ✅ Homepage Service Plans Section Updated

## What Changed:

**OLD:** 4 pricing cards showing combined residential/commercial pricing (confusing)

**NEW:** 2 large clickable cards directing to separate plan pages:
- **Commercial Plans** (blue) → `/commercial-service-plans.html`
- **Residential Plans** (amber) → `/residential-service-plans.html`

---

## New Design Features:

✅ **Cleaner presentation** - Eliminates confusion about residential vs commercial pricing
✅ **Clear calls-to-action** - Big clickable cards with hover effects
✅ **Starting prices shown** - Quick reference without overwhelming detail
✅ **Icon differentiation** - Building icon for commercial, home icon for residential
✅ **Better user flow** - Users choose their path first, then see relevant plans
✅ **Consistent with service-plans.html** - Same design pattern as the landing page
