# ✅ GOVERNMENT CARD & PAGE FIXED - December 28, 2024

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### User Request
> "this government card image is still not a good one. Please change it. The trusted by government agencies logo should be pulled from the images client folder, they don't look good as text"

### ✅ Completed Changes

#### 1. **Government Card Image UPDATED** (Commercial Page)
**File:** `commercial.html`
- **Old:** Generic government building exterior (poor quality GenSpark image)
- **New:** Professional Council Chambers with visible AV technology
- **Shows:** Actual government meeting space with displays, microphones, AV systems
- **Quality:** High-resolution, professional AV installation photo

#### 2. **Government Landing Page Hero UPDATED**
**File:** `industries/government.html`
- **Hero Banner:** Updated to match new council chambers image
- **Consistency:** Government card and landing page now use the same professional image

**File:** `industries/government.html`
- **Replaced:** Text-only client names
- **Added:** 3 actual government client logos from `images/clients/` folder:
  1. **DRCOG** (Denver Regional Council of Governments) - `images/clients/drcog.png`
  2. **City of Aurora** - `images/clients/city_of_aurora.png`
  3. **USAF Space Command** - `images/clients/usaf_space_command.png`

- **Design Features:**
