### Files Updated:

1. ✅ `index.html` - Main homepage footer
2. ✅ `residential/home-theater.html`
3. ✅ `residential/whole-home-audio.html`
4. ✅ `residential/lighting-control.html`

### Logo Path Used:

```html
<img src="images/logo-2/King Systems Hoodie Logo 2024 - 1000 x 701.png" alt="King Systems" class="h-16 w-auto mb-4">
```

**For subpages:**
```html

```

### Logo Styling:

- `h-16` = Height of 64px (4rem)
- `w-auto` = Width scales proportionally
- `mb-4` = Margin bottom 16px
- Maintains aspect ratio

## Note About Other Pages:

The following pages have **simpler footers without the logo section**:
- `commercial.html`
- All `/commercial/` subpages
- `residential.html`
- Service plan pages
- About, contact, blog, etc.

These pages only have a copyright line and don't display a logo in the footer. If you want the logo added to these pages too, let me know!
