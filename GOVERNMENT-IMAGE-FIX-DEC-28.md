# Government Card & Page Image Update - December 28, 2024

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem
User requested to replace the government card image which "is still not a good one" and to replace the text-based "Trusted by Government Agencies" section with actual client logos from the images/clients folder.

### Solution

#### 1. Government Card Image (Commercial Page)
**File:** `commercial.html`
**Change:** Updated government industry card background image
- **Old:** Generic government building exterior
- **New:** Professional Council Chambers AV System - shows visible displays, microphones, and AV technology in an actual government chambers setting

#### 2. Government Landing Page Hero
**File:** `industries/government.html`
**Change:** Updated hero banner to match the new government card image
- Professional Council Chambers with visible AV technology
- Shows real government AV installation

#### 3. Client Logos Added
**File:** `industries/government.html`
**Change:** Replaced text-only client list with actual government client logos
- **Added 3 Government Client Logos:**
  1. DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) - `images/clients/drcog.png`
  2. City of Aurora - `images/clients/city_of_aurora.png`
  3. USAF Space Command - `images/clients/usaf_space_command.png`
- **Kept as text:** US Air Force Academy, Army National Guard, City of Englewood
- **Design:** Logos shown with grayscale filter, color on hover
