# 🎯 GOVERNMENT CLIENT LOGOS NEEDED

## Current Situation

### ✅ Logo You HAVE in GitHub:
- `images/clients/drcog.png` - Denver Regional Council of Governments ✅

### ❌ Logos You NEED to Add:

Based on your government clients mentioned on the website, you need these logo files:

1. **city_of_aurora.png**
   - Client: City of Aurora, Colorado
   - File name: `city_of_aurora.png`
   - Upload to: `images/clients/`
   - Currently referenced in: commercial.html, industries/government.html

2. **usaf_space_command.png**
   - Client: US Air Force Space Command
   - File name: `usaf_space_command.png`
   - Upload to: `images/clients/`
   - Currently referenced in: commercial.html, industries/government.html

## Optional Additional Government Logos

If you have logos for these clients, they would also be great to add:

3. **us_air_force_academy.png** (Optional)
   - Client: US Air Force Academy
   - Currently shown as text only
   - Would replace text with logo

4. **army_national_guard.png** (Optional)
   - Client: Army National Guard
   - Currently shown as text only
   - Would replace text with logo

5. **city_of_englewood.png** (Optional)

## 📁 Where to Upload

All logo files should go here:

### File Naming Convention:

## 🚀 Priority

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Needed Now):
1. **city_of_aurora.png** - Referenced but missing, will show broken image
2. **usaf_space_command.png** - Referenced but missing, will show broken image

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have):
3. **us_air_force_academy.png** - Would enhance the page

## ✅ After You Add the Logos

Once you upload `city_of_aurora.png` and `usaf_space_command.png` to `images/clients/` in GitHub, I'll update the government page to show them as logos instead of text.

**Then you'll have:**
- ✅ 3 government client logos displayed (DRCOG, City of Aurora, USAF Space Command)
- ✅ 3 additional clients as text (Air Force Academy, Army National Guard, City of Englewood)
- ✅ Professional visual proof of government sector experience
