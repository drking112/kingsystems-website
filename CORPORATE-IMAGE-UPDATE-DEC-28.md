# 🖼️ CORPORATE PAGE IMAGE UPDATE - December 28, 2024

## ❌ Problem

The Corporate industry page (`industries/corporate.html`) had the **same image** as the main Commercial page (`commercial.html`), causing visual repetition across the site.

**Duplicate Image Used On:**
- ❌ Homepage (`index.html`)
- ❌ Main Commercial page (`commercial.html`)
- ❌ Corporate industry page (`industries/corporate.html`)
- ❌ Blog page (`blog.html`)

---

## ✅ Solution

**Changed the Corporate industry page to use a unique executive boardroom image** that better represents high-end corporate AV technology.

### New Corporate Image:
**Cisco Executive Boardroom Blueprint**
- Shows premium executive boardroom with advanced technology
- Multiple displays and professional AV integration visible
- High-end corporate environment
- Modern, professional aesthetic
