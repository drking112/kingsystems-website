## 📦 Files to Copy from GenSpark to GitHub

### **IMPORTANT: What NOT to Copy**
❌ **DO NOT copy `images/` folder from GenSpark to GitHub**
- Your GitHub already has all the portfolio images in `images/Portfolio/`
- Your GitHub already has all 60 client logos in `images/clients/`
- Your GitHub already has all 17 partner logos in `images/partners/`
- Copying from GenSpark would OVERWRITE your GitHub images with fewer files!

#### **1. Case Study Pages** (NEW)
```
case-studies/air-force-academy-falcon-stadium.html
case-studies/unicom-capital-penthouse.html
```

#### **2. Portfolio Main Page** (UPDATED)
```
case-studies.html
```

#### **3. Industry Pages** (UPDATED)
```
industries/corporate.html (has new interactive demo)
industries/education.html (new hero image)
industries/healthcare.html (new hero image)
industries/government.html (new hero image)
```

#### **4. Commercial Pages** (UPDATED)
```
commercial/conference-rooms.html (new hero image)
commercial/digital-signage.html (new hero image)
```

#### **5. Main Pages** (UPDATED)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If images don't show:**
1. **Hard refresh browser:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Check cache bypass URL** - use `?v=randomnumber` at end
3. **Open incognito window** to bypass all cache
4. **Verify image paths in GitHub:**
   - `images/Portfolio/USAF Academy/Falcon Stadium.png`
   - `images/Portfolio/USAF Academy/Picture2.png`
   - etc.

### **If old content shows:**
1. **Wait 5 minutes** - Cloudflare deployment may still be processing
2. **Check Cloudflare Pages dashboard** - ensure deployment shows "Success"
3. **Clear browser cache completely**
4. **Try different browser**

### **If case study photos are broken:**
- Verify the folder name in GitHub is exactly: `images/Portfolio/USAF Academy/`
- Note: Capital "P" in Portfolio, space between "USAF" and "Academy"
- File extensions are case-sensitive: `.png` vs `.PNG` vs `.jpg` vs `.JPG`
