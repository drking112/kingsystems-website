# ✅ GOVERNMENT PAGE - TIERED CLIENT STRUCTURE - December 28, 2024

## User Request: "Both"

User wants to show BOTH federal/military authority AND municipal expertise on the government page.

## ✅ Solution: Two-Tier Structure

Created a visually organized hierarchy that highlights federal clients while also showcasing municipal work.

## 🎯 New Structure

### Tier 1: Federal & Military Clients (Premium Positioning)
**Visual Treatment:**
- Section header: "Federal & Military Clients"
- Large logos (h-20 / 80px height)
- Grayscale with hover to color
- Prominent placement at top

**Clients Shown:**
- ✅ US Air Force Academy (logo)
- ✅ USAF Space Command (logo)
- ✅ Army National Guard (text)

**Why This Works:**
- Establishes federal/military credibility first
- Largest logos = highest authority
- Clear visual hierarchy

---

### Tier 2: Regional & Municipal Partners (Volume & Breadth)
**Visual Treatment:**
- Divider line separates from federal
- Section header: "Regional & Municipal Partners"
- Large logos for major partners (h-20)
- Small blue badges for additional cities
- Clean, organized pill-style layout

**Clients Shown:**
- ✅ DRCOG (logo) - Regional authority
- ✅ City of Aurora (logo) - Major city
- ✅ City of Brighton (badge) - Municipal
- ✅ City of Englewood (badge) - Municipal
- ✅ City of Commerce City (badge) - Municipal
- ✅ Town of Castle Rock (badge) - Municipal

**Why This Works:**
- Shows municipal specialization
- Doesn't dilute federal positioning
- Easy to add more cities (just add badges)
- Professional "pill badge" design
