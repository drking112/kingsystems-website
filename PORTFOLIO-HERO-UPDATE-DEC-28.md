# 🏢 PORTFOLIO PAGE HERO UPDATE - December 28, 2024

## ❌ Problem

The Portfolio/Case Studies page header had a **residential house image**, which didn't match the enterprise commercial focus of the portfolio content.

**Old Image:** Residential luxury home exterior

**Replaced with Denver downtown commercial skyline** showing modern office buildings and corporate business district.

### New Portfolio Hero Image:
**Denver Downtown at Sunset**
- Professional Colorado business district
- Modern commercial office buildings
- Enterprise-focused skyline view
- Represents your Colorado service area
- Matches the commercial/corporate portfolio projects below
