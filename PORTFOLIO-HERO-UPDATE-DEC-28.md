# 🏢 PORTFOLIO PAGE HERO UPDATE - December 28, 2024

## ❌ Problem

The Portfolio/Case Studies page had two issues:
1. **Residential house image** that didn't match enterprise commercial focus
2. Text said "Our Work Across Colorado" (too limited in scope)

**Old Image:** Residential luxury home exterior  
**Old Text:** "Our Work Across Colorado"

---

## ✅ Solution

**1. Updated Image:** Street-level downtown commercial district view  
**2. Updated Text:** "Our Work Across the Nation"

### New Portfolio Hero Image:
**Downtown Street with Commercial Buildings**
- Street-level perspective showing modern commercial architecture
- Professional urban business district
- Shows building facades and street view (not aerial/rooftop)
- Enterprise-focused commercial environment
- Better represents nationwide portfolio reach

- More relatable and professional than aerial shots
- Better represents the type of facilities you work in
- Gives sense of scale and urban business district

**Visual Consistency:**
